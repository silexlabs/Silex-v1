********************

Click on the ViewMenu's snapShot button.

********************
**  Content       **
********************

The snapshot plugin folder contains several files:

	index.php:
		contains the php and the links to the swf files needed to load the plugin. It inserts a reference to snap_shot_tool_view_menu_item.swf in the admin api's view menu items. It then loads snapshot_tool.swf in silex. Finally it has the two javascript functions used by the 2 swfs to communicate by ExternalInterface function.
		
	snap_shot_tool_view_menu_item.swf:
		the snapshot button visible in the viewmenu. (AS3)
		
	snapshot_tool.swf:
		Handles the snapshot process.
		When ViewMenu's snapShot button is clicked, it retrieves the plugin config, stores all the plugin info and pixel info in an object and send the object to write_image.php to be saved.
