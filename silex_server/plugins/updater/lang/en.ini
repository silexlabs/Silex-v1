MAIN_SILEX_UPDT_SERVER_ERR=It seems to be impossible to contact the update server from your Silex server.<br><br> If you can access the update server at the address %s/latest_silex_version.php from your computer, it probably means that the problem comes from the host of your Silex server that either doesn't allow it to perform outgoing requests, or eventually because of a temporary problem. You may contact him directly for further information.

MAIN_SILEX_UPDT_EXST_MSG=You are not running the latest version of Silex. For better performances and reliability, it is strongly recommended to update your Silex server.

;UPDATE SILEX SERVER

UPDT_SILEX_SRV_TEMP_DIR_PERM_ERR=To perform the update, the temporary directory %s must be first cleared. The permissions of the files below are too restricted to allow the PHP process to delete them. Please adjust them accordingly.
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_SILEX_TREE_PERM_ERR=The following folders/files permissions are too restricted for the update to proceed correctly. Please adjust them accordingly to allow the parsing of the entire Silex server tree by the PHP process. This can be done on your server through your FTP client.
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_SIG_MISMATCH_ERR=This file has not the expected signature: %s<br>It can be because of a network or server issue. If the problem persists, you may contact the administrators of the Silex update.

UPDT_SILEX_SRV_GENERATE_PREUPDT_RPT_MSG=Generating pre-update report...
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_RUN_INFO_MSG=It is strongly recommended not to run any other application on your workstation during the update processing. Also, you shouldn't allow any FTP access to your Silex server during the update.

UPDT_SILEX_SRV_UPDATE_LIST_MSG=The following files will be updated. The files in red color have been modified since the last installation/update of your Silex server. If you want to backup them, copy them manually before starting this process again.<br>
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_OBSOLETE_LIST_MSG=<br><br>The following files are not useful anymore in the new version. As it is not recommended to keep used files (especially swf files because of the class conflicts it could make), the update process will delete these files by default. However, if you would like keep some of them, please check those you want to keep so they are not deleted during the update process.<br>
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_NOFILE_MSG=No file to update has been found.
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_DOWNLOAD_SUCCESS_MSG=All files have been downloaded successfully.

UPDT_SILEX_SRV_UPDATE_SUCCESS_MSG=Update performed
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_DELETE_FAILED_MSG=The update process failed to delete the below files/directories. It can be because of too restritive access permissions or simply because the file/folder is currently in use. You may try to delete them manually.
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_UPDATE_PERFORMED_MSG=Update Performed. All obsolete files and directories have been successfully deleted.
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_UPDATE_FAILED_MSG=The update process failed to replace the files and folders listed below. It may be because of too restricted permissions on these files and folders so you may ensure that the PHP process has the WRITE rights on them and you may retry the update then. If the problem persists and to know more about the source of the problem, set your Silex logging level (in /conf/log.ini) to INFO and reproduce the problem again. If the problem occurs when your logging level is at INFO (or DEBUG), post your log file (that you can find in the /logs directory of you Silex server) on the community forum. Someone should then be able to help you out.
UPDT_SILEX_SRV_PERM_MSG=The PHP process has sufficient access rights to update your Silex server.
