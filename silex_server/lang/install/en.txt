TEST_RIGHTS_CHMOD_NOK=Error: the access rights could not be changed to 755.&
TEST_RIGHTS_HELP=You don't have the rights on the file system and silex couldn't get them for you. This means you can't do certain things with silex, but it should be ok for a visitor. Try setting them yourself, with your FTP client for example <br/> <br/> Silex needs read, write and execute rights(0755) on the media, contents, and logs directories and on cgi/scripts/upload.cgi .<br/>If all else fails you can still use this site without editing it. To do this, create an empty file at conf/pass.php&

TEST_SESSION_HELP=Your host doesn't allow sessions. Silex needs sessions to run properly. &
TEST_PHP_VERSION_HELP=PHP 5 or more is needed. Some web hosts provide an older PHP by default, and sometimes this can be changed. To do this you need to try adding a file called .htaccess at the root of silex, and try a variety of ways of setting the PHP version to 5. Try adding one of the following lines to it, then refresh. If this doesn't work, try another. <br/> <br/> SetEnv PHP_VER 5 <br/> AddHandler x-httpd-php5 .php <br/> AddType x-mapp-php5 .php <br/>AddType application/x-httpd-php5 .php<br/>&
TEST_SET_INCLUDE_PATH_HELP=Your host doesn't allow set_include_path. Silex needs set_include_path to run properly. &
