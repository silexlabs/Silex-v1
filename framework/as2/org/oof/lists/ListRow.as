/** This component holds information about a list row and is needed by oof lists. 
 * If you use an oof list in flash, this component must be in your library.
 * It would be nice to eliminate this class, but at the moment it's still necessary.
 * Historically this class inherits from mx.core.UIComponent, but since 12/10 this creates issues, so copy the necessary bits here. A.S.
