This is the haXe project for Silex index.php file

At the moment, compiling haxeindex requires a svn version of haXe.
This is needed because we need support for --php-lib that's been introduced very recently in the haXe compiler.

You may find nightly builds of haXe at http://haxe.cmt.tc/ (also see http://haxe.org/download).

You will need to replace your haxe executable file and the std directory by the ones found in the archive you've downloaded.
On Windows, these should be in c:\haxe
On MacOSX, these should be in /usr/lib/haxe
